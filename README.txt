This should be our school project for the database course..

Actually, "Mr.Baker" was Nadine's idea <nadine_el_naggar@hotmail.com>
(another project member)

I was impressed by how jQuery can expands forms & drag people to fill out more information with just few fieldsâ€¦

It should be soon running on http://yoga1290.awardspace.info/project7/
